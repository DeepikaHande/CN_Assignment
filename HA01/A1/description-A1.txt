Working of the program:This program takes an ip address as the input, checks whether its valid,and then checks if it's publicly assignable or not.
		       
Input and output: 1. Enter IP address: 0.0.0.0
                     The IP address is valid,
                     But is not publically assignable

	                2. Enter IP address: 123.25.9.122
		                 The IP address is valid,
	                   And is publically assignable
	          
                  3. Enter IP address: 256.34.78.222
		                 Invalid Ip address

Things learnt: An ip address is said to be valid if it is of the form 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' where xxx can be a number from 0-255.
 	             An ip address that your home or business router recieves from your ISP (internet service provider) is called a publicly 
	             assignable ip address.
	             The range of the publicly assignable ip addresses should be  -> 1.0.0.1 - 9.255.255.255
							                                                              -> 11.0.0.1 - 126.255.255.255
							                                                              -> 127.0.0.1 - 127.0.0.255
							                                                              -> 128.0.0.1 - 239.255.255.255
